/// id problem:
/// - nice if command-handler do not return data, if we want id in creation-command we can create it before sending command
/// natural key-are nice
/// - but we can be also pragmatic and return id from command handler, when id is generated in database
/// - hibride - database has own id + snowflake-id
/// 
/// cqs - separation on method level vs cqrs on objects level (command + command-handler, query + query-handler)
/// 
/// full blown with separate write-side and query-side (separate stores)
/// only on full-blown level of cqrs one can apply event-sourcing
